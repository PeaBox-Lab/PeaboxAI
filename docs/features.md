✅ Switch providers in seconds

---

## Self-Hosted AI

Run AI models on your own infrastructure.

Examples:

- Qwen
- Llama
- Gemma
- DeepSeek
- Mistral
- Phi

### Deployment Options

### Benefits

✅ No public Ollama endpoint required

✅ SSH key authentication

✅ Encrypted communication

✅ Enterprise-friendly architecture

---

## Direct Ollama Support

Connect directly to:

```text
localhost
LAN servers
VPN servers
Private gateways
```

Examples:

```text
http://localhost:11434

http://192.168.1.20:11434

https://ollama.company.com
```

### Benefits

✅ Simple setup

✅ Fast local access

✅ Automatic model discovery

---

## Automatic Model Discovery

Workbench automatically discovers available models.

Examples:

```text
qwen3:8b
qwen2.5:1.5b
gemma3
llama
deepseek
```

### Retrieved Information

- Model name
- Parameter size
- Quantization level
- Context size
- Capabilities
- Default parameters

### Benefits

✅ No manual model configuration

✅ Easier onboarding

✅ Reduced setup errors

---

## Capability Detection

Workbench automatically determines model capabilities.

Detected capabilities may include:

```text
Chat
Thinking / Reasoning
Vision
```

For Ollama, capabilities come from the server. For cloud and OpenAI-compatible providers they are inferred from the model name.

### Benefits

✅ Dynamic UI behavior

✅ Only relevant options are displayed

✅ Less user confusion

---

## Chat History

Conversations are stored locally.

History survives:

- Restarts
- Upgrades
- System reboots

### Benefits

✅ Long-term context

✅ Easier research

✅ Better productivity

---

## Conversation Memory

Previous messages are automatically supplied to the model.

### Examples

```text
Summarize the discussion.
```

```text
Expand the second recommendation.
```

```text
Create an action plan from what we discussed.
```

### Benefits

✅ Natural conversations

✅ Reduced repetition

✅ Better context retention

---

## Document Analysis

Upload business documents and ask questions.

Supported formats:

- PDF
- DOCX
- XLSX
- CSV

---

## Image Analysis

Supported formats:

- PNG
- JPG
- JPEG
- WEBP

Available for vision-capable models.

### Example Use Cases

---

## Thinking and Reasoning Controls

Supported reasoning models can expose configurable reasoning levels.

Options:

```text
Default
Off
Low
Medium
High
```

### Benefits

✅ Faster responses when needed

✅ Deeper analysis when required

✅ Better control over model behavior

---

## Model Parameters

Use model defaults or customize generation settings.

Supported controls:

- Temperature
